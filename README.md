## Project Overview

This project develops an intelligent fabric classification system using machine learning to revolutionize textile waste sorting. By enabling consumers to sort fabrics at the source, we aim to reduce the environmental impact of textile waste while making recycling more efficient and cost-effective.

## Problem Statement

The fashion industry generates up to 92 million tons of textile waste annually, with only 15% being recycled. Manual sorting is time-consuming and often inaccurate, while industrial sorting methods are expensive and complex. Our solution democratizes the sorting process, making it accessible to individuals and organizations alike.

## Expected Outcomes

### Technical Outcomes:

* A mobile application capable of accurately identifying different fabric types through image processing
* An AI model with high accuracy in fabric classification
* A user-friendly interface that provides instant feedback on fabric type and recycling recommendations

### Environmental Outcomes:

* Increased textile recycling rates through improved sorting accuracy
* Reduced landfill waste from textiles
* Support for a more circular economy in the fashion industry

### Social Outcomes:

* Enhanced consumer awareness about fabric types and recycling
* Potential job creation in the recycling sector
